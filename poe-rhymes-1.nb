Perched upon a bust of Pallas just above my chamber door-- Perched, and sat, \

By the grave and stern decorum of the countenance it wore, \\\"Though thy \

not an instant stopped or stayed he; But, with mien of lord or lady, perched \

bore; For we cannot help agreeing that no living human being Ever yet was \
blessed with seeing bird above his chamber door-- Bird or beast upon the \
sculptured bust above his chamber door, With such name as \\\"Nevermore.\\\" \
But the Raven, sitting lonely on that placid bust, spoke only That one word, \
as if his soul in that one word he did outpour. Nothing further then he \
uttered--not a feather then he fluttered-- Till I scarcely more than \
muttered, \\\"Other friends have flown before-- On the morrow _he_ will leave \
me, as my hopes have flown before.\\\" Then the bird said, \\\"Nevermore.\\\" \

door; Then, upon the velvet sinking, I betook myself to linking Fancy unto \

ghastly, gaunt, and ominous bird of yore Meant in croaking \\\"Nevermore.\\\" \
This I sat engaged in guessing, but no syllable expressing To the fowl whose \
fiery eyes now burned into my bosom's core; This and more I sat divining, \
with my head at ease reclining On the cushion's velvet lining that the \
lamp-light gloated o'er, But whose velvet violet lining with the lamp-light \
gloating o'er, She shall press, ah, nevermore! Then, methought, the air grew \
denser, perfumed from an unseen censer Swung by Seraphim whose foot-falls \
tinkled on the tufted floor. \\\"Wretch,\\\" I cried, \\\"thy God hath lent \

weak and weary, Over many a quaint and curious volume of forgotten lore-- \
While I nodded, nearly napping, suddenly there came a tapping, As of some one \
gently rapping--rapping at my chamber door. \\\"'Tis some visitor,\\\" I \
muttered, \\\"tapping at my chamber door-- Only this and nothing more.\\\" \
Ah, distinctly I remember, it was in the bleak December, And each separate \
dying ember wrought its ghost upon the floor. Eagerly I wished the \
morrow;--vainly I had sought to borrow From my books surcease of \
sorrow--sorrow for the lost Lenore-- For the rare and radiant maiden whom the \
angels name Lenore-- Nameless here for evermore. And the silken sad uncertain \
rustling of each purple curtain Thrilled me--filled me with fantastic terrors \
never felt before; So that now, to still the beating of my heart, I stood \
repeating \\\"'Tis some visitor entreating entrance at my chamber door-- Some \
late visitor entreating entrance at my chamber door;-- This it is and nothing \
more.\\\" Presently my soul grew stronger; hesitating then no longer, \
\\\"Sir,\\\" said I, \\\"or Madam, truly your forgiveness I implore; But the \

came tapping--tapping at my chamber door, That I scarce was sure I heard \
you\\\"--here I opened wide the door:-- Darkness there and nothing more. Deep \
into that darkness peering, long I stood there wondering, fearing, Doubting, \
dreaming dreams no mortal ever dared to dream before; But the silence was \
unbroken, and the darkness gave no token, And the only word there spoken was \
the whispered word, \\\"Lenore!\\\" This I whispered, and an echo murmured \
back the word, \\\"Lenore!\\\" Merely this and nothing more. Back into the \
chamber turning, all my soul within me burning, Soon I heard again a tapping, \
somewhat louder than before. \\\"Surely,\\\" said I, \\\"surely that is \
something at my window lattice; Let me see, then, what thereat is, and this \
mystery explore-- Let my heart be still a moment, and this mystery explore;-- \
'Tis the wind and nothing more.\\\" Open here I flung the shutter, when, with \
many a flirt and flutter, In there stepped a stately Raven of the saintly \
days of yore; Not the least obeisance made he: not an instant stopped or \
stayed he; But, with mien of lord or lady, perched above my chamber door-- \
Perched upon a bust of Pallas just above my chamber door-- Perched, and sat, \
and nothing more. Then this ebony bird beguiling my sad fancy into smiling, \
By the grave and stern decorum of the countenance it wore, \\\"Though thy \
crest be shorn and shaven, thou,\\\" I said, \\\"art sure no craven, Ghastly \
grim and ancient Raven wandering from the Nightly shore-- Tell me what thy \
lordly name is on the Night's Plutonian shore!\\\" Quoth the Raven, \
\\\"Nevermore.\\\" Much I marvelled this ungainly fowl to hear discourse so \
plainly, Though its answer little meaning--little relevancy bore; For we \
cannot help agreeing that no living human being Ever yet was blessed with \
seeing bird above his chamber door-- Bird or beast upon the sculptured bust \
above his chamber door, With such name as \\\"Nevermore.\\\" But the Raven, \
sitting lonely on that placid bust, spoke only That one word, as if his soul \
in that one word he did outpour. Nothing further then he uttered--not a \
feather then he fluttered-- Till I scarcely more than muttered, \\\"Other \
friends have flown before-- On the morrow _he_ will leave me, as my hopes \
have flown before.\\\" Then the bird said, \\\"Nevermore.\\\" Startled at the \

By the grave and stern decorum of the countenance it wore, \\\"Though thy \

grim and ancient Raven wandering from the Nightly shore-- Tell me what thy \

\"Nevermore.\\\" But the Raven, sitting lonely on that placid bust, spoke \
only That one word, as if his soul in that one word he did outpour. Nothing \
further then he uttered--not a feather then he fluttered-- Till I scarcely \
more than muttered, \\\"Other friends have flown before-- On the morrow _he_ \
will leave me, as my hopes have flown before.\\\" Then the bird said, \
\\\"Nevermore.\\\" Startled at the stillness broken by reply so aptly spoken, \
\\\"Doubtless,\\\" said I, \\\"what it utters is its only stock and store, \
Caught from some unhappy master whom unmerciful Disaster Followed fast and \
followed faster till his songs one burden bore-- Till the dirges of his Hope \
the melancholy burden bore Of 'Never--nevermore.'\\\" But the Raven still \
beguiling all my sad soul into smiling, Straight I wheeled a cushioned seat \
in front of bird and bust and door; Then, upon the velvet sinking, I betook \
myself to linking Fancy unto fancy, thinking what this ominous bird of yore-- \
What this grim, ungainly, ghastly, gaunt, and ominous bird of yore Meant in \
croaking \\\"Nevermore.\\\" This I sat engaged in guessing, but no syllable \
expressing To the fowl whose fiery eyes now burned into my bosom's core; This \
and more I sat divining, with my head at ease reclining On the cushion's \
velvet lining that the lamp-light gloated o'er, But whose velvet violet \
lining with the lamp-light gloating o'er, She shall press, ah, nevermore! \
Then, methought, the air grew denser, perfumed from an unseen censer Swung by \
Seraphim whose foot-falls tinkled on the tufted floor. \\\"Wretch,\\\" I \
cried, \\\"thy God hath lent thee--by these angels he hath sent thee \
Respite--respite aad nepenth\[CapitalATilde]\[Copyright] from thy memories of \
Lenore! Quaff, oh quaff this kind nepenth\[CapitalATilde]\[Copyright], and \
forget this lost Lenore!\\\" Quoth the Raven, \\\"Nevermore.\\\" \\\"Prophet!\
\\\" said I, \\\"thing of evil!--prophet still, if bird or devil!-- Whether \
Tempter sent, or whether tempest tossed thee here ashore, Desolate yet all \
undaunted, on this desert land enchanted-- On this home by Horror \
haunted--tell me truly, I implore-- Is there--_is_ there balm in \
Gilead?--tell me--tell me, I implore!\\\" Quoth the Raven, \\\"Nevermore.\\\" \
\\\"Prophet!\\\" said I, \\\"thing of evil!--prophet still, if bird or devil! \
By that Heaven that bends above us--by that God we both adore-- Tell this \
soul with sorrow laden if, within the distant Aidenn, It shall clasp a \
sainted maiden whom the angels name Lenore-- Clasp a rare and radiant maiden \
whom the angels name Lenore.\\\" Quoth the Raven, \\\"Nevermore.\\\" \\\"Be \
that word our sign of parting, bird or fiend!\\\" I shrieked, upstarting-- \\\
\"Get thee back into the tempest and the Night's Plutonian shore! Leave no \
black plume as a token of that lie thy soul hath spoken! Leave my loneliness \
unbroken!--quit the bust above my door! Take thy beak from out my heart, and \
